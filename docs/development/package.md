Your package:
- MUST be secure as much as possible.
- MUST do only one thing and do it well.
- SHOULD provide a comprehensive amount of settings to be able to completely configure the package for custom needs.
- SHOULD work without or with a minimum configuration after installation. It means that it's preferably to always use settings automatically configured with best practices, but exposed for changes.
- SHOULD use as fewer shorthands in code or configuration paths as possible. The exception may be well-known shorthands and shorthands of huge words.
